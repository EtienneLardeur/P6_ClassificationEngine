# P6_ClassificationEngine
 
The purpose of this project is to benchmark text and image processing techniques to build features as input for a classifier that should help to sort products into their categories.<br/>
Bag of words, Bag of visual Words. <br/>
We use SIFT (equivalent to SURF, ORB) and CNN VGG16 for image features extraction (after assessment of CNN for rough prediction).<br/>
We use nltk, tf-idf, and gensim for text features extraction.<br/>
We can combine many techniques and upgrade to multi-label predictions.<br/>
